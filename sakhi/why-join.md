## Ambience

Imagine a place where the colouring of city-life just washes away  and you feel- pristine and magnificent as wished by the Creator.

A place for much 

* **healing** - outward and inward
* **learning** - ancient as well as contemporary
* **growing** - as an individual and as a community
